# Property_Web_Scraper

This program uses selenium and beautiful soup to retrieve a list of the latest properties in Gravesend
Changing the address in browser.get will allow you to change the location of the search

Each listing will be output with the description, price and link to the listing

I have used Pandas to put all of the data into a dataframe, and each full scrape is exported to a .xlsx
